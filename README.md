# Class Card Gen - [FrogLabs](https://github.com/froglabscl/)
In the different projects it is sometimes necessary to practice internal tools that facilitate the work of the people working on it, so I wanted to put into practice my skills in [React](https://reactjs.org).
## Principal Idea
In [FrogLabs](https://github.com/froglabscl/) we have different cards for each class which take the data and information from the API, but for that you have to upload the card information somehow, so I developed a tool that makes all this easier and gives a more intuitive interface.
## How to make it work?
The first thing to do is to clone the repository, once you have done this, enter the repository with

´´´bash
cd clascardgen
´´´

and then we will have to install all the dependencies with

´´´bash
npm install
´´´

and to start our project we will do it with

´´´bash
npm start
´´´
